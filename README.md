Welcome to the repository for the Intelligent Cockpit Terminal Design project! This project aims to create a smart and integrated cockpit system that enhances passenger comfort and provides intelligent control through a combination of hardware, software, and IoT cloud platforms.

Project Overview
Research Content
This project integrates a remote IoT cloud platform, software system, and hardware system to build an intelligent cockpit terminal. The primary focus areas include:

Cockpit Environment Monitoring: Real-time data collection and analysis of the cabin environment.
Intelligent Control: Automated and customizable control of cabin features.
Remote Monitoring: Access to cockpit data via a cloud platform for real-time oversight.
Expected Goals
Design and implement a fully functional intelligent cockpit terminal system.
Achieve stable operation across all major features.
Enhance user comfort and provide enterprises with a competitive, cost-effective solution.
Technical Approach
The project combines software development and hardware integration, divided into three core components:

Hardware System Setup: Physical infrastructure for data collection and control.
Remote Cloud Platform: Data aggregation and remote access via IoT.
Display Interface: User-friendly GUI for interaction.
